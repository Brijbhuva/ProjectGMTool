		When Pat sees a need to learn new technology, she <span style="color:red;"><u>does so by trying out new features</u></span> or commands to see what they do and to understand how the software works. When she does this, she <span style="color:red;"><u>does so purposefully; that is, she reflects on each bit of feedback she gets</u></span> along the way to understand how the feature might benefit her. Eventually, if she doesn't think it will get her closer to what she wants to achieve, she will <span style="color:red;"><u>revert back to ways that she already knows will work.</u></span>
