		When Pat sees a need to learn new technology, she does so by trying out new features or commands to see what they do and to understand how the software works. When she does this, she does so purposefully; that is, she reflects on each bit of feedback she gets along the way to understand how the feature might benefit her. Eventually, if she doesn't think it will get her closer to what she wants to achieve, she will revert back to ways that she already knows will work.
