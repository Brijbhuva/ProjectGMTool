		Pat has <span style="color:red;"><u>medium computer self-efficacy,</u></span> meaning that she has some self-confidence in performing computing tasks other than the ones she is familiar with. This has a variety of impacts on how she uses software. For example, she will keep on trying to figure out how to achieve what she has set out to do for quite awhile; she doesn't give up right away when computers or technology present a challenge to her.
