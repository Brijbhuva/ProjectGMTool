                When he is exploring or searching for information to solve a problem with a computer program or gadget he uses, he likes a <i>selective information processing style</i> or “depth first” approach. That is, he usually <span style="color:red;"><u>delves into the first promising option, pursues it, and if it doesn’t work out he backs out</u></span> and gathers a bit more information until he sees <span style="color:red;"><u>another option to try.</u></span> Thus, his style is very incremental.
