			When Tim is exploring or searching for information to solve a problem with a computer program or gadget he uses, he likes a selective information processing style or "depth first" approach. That is, he usually delves into the first promising option, pursues it, and if it doesn't work out he backs out and gathers a bit more information until he sees another option to try. Thus, his style is very incremental.
