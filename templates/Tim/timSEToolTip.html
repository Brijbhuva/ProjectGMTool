	Tim is very confident in his abilities with technology, and thinks he's better than the average person at learning about new features. He doesn't give up easily when computers or technology present a challenge to him. He will spend hours reading the manual so he can configure something to do exactly what he wants to do. If he can't fix the problem, he blames it on the software vendor; it's not his fault if he can't get it to work.
