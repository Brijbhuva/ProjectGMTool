			Abby leans towards a <i>comprehensive information processing style</i>
			when she needs to gather information to problem-solve. That is, before following any option that seems promising, she first 
			<span style="color:red;">gathers information comprehensively to try to form a complete understanding of the problem before trying to solve it</span>. 
			Thus, her style is “burst-y”; first she reads a lot, then she acts on it in a batch of activity.
