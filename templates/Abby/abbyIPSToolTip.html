			Abby leans towards a comprehensive information processing style when she needs to gather information to problem-solve. That is, before following any option that seems promising, she first gathers information comprehensively to try to form a complete understanding of the problem before trying to solve it. Thus, her style is "burst-y"; first she reads a lot, then she acts on it in a batch of activity.
