			Abby is <span style="color:red;"><u>proficient with the technologies she uses.</u></span> She learns new technologies when she needs to, but she doesnâ€™t spend her free time exploring technology or exploring obscure functionality of programs and devices that she uses. When Abby uses computers to problem-solve, she has <span style="color:red;"><u>little desire to learn new functions</u></span>, or to search for information on them.  She tries to use methods she is <span style="color:red;"><u>already familiar and comfortable with</u></span> to achieve her goals.
