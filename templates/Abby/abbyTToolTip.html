		Abby <span style="color:red;"><u>doesn't particularly like tinkering with software</u></span> (ie, just trying out new features or commands to see what they do) when she uses software in her work tasks.  Instead, she prefers <span style="color:red;"><u>following step-by-step tutorials and wizards.</u></span> (However, when she does tinker, it has positive effects on her understanding of the software.) When software features/commands cause problems for her, she <span style="color:red;"><u>tends to blame herself</u></span> and, if she can, she then <span style="color:red;"><u>just avoids those troublesome features/commands.</u></span> She then uses work-arounds that involve using <span style="color:red;"><u>only features/commands she is familiar with already.</u></span>
