		NUKED! Pat leans towards a <i>comprehensive information processing style</i> when he needs to gather information to problem-solve. That is, before following some option that seems promising, he <span style="color:red;"><u>first gathers information comprehensively to try to form a complete understanding of the problem before trying to solve it.</u></span> Thus, his style is "burst-y"; first he reads a lot, then he acts on it in a batch of activity.
