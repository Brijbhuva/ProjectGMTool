		When Pat sees a need to learn new technology, he does so by trying out new features or commands to see what they do and to understand how the software works. When he does this, he does so purposefully; that is, he reflects on each bit of feedback he gets along the way to understand how the feature might benefit him. Eventually, if he doesn't think it will get him closer to what he wants to achieve, he will revert back to ways that he already knows will work.
